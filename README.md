Easily force a Plugin or Theme reinstall from WordPress.org

## Description

Ever had an update break in the middle or simply not sure if your plugins are still intact after malware removal or maybe just something else?

Then you have come across the correct plugin, just click `No updates` and plugin will set the plugin or theme as needing an update thus forcing WordPress to update the plugin or theme.

This is only temporarily set and is reset when you visit the updates page or update a single plugin/theme so you don't have to worry about any plugin or theme files being manipulated

## Installation

### Automatic installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option -- WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Zimrate, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”

In the search field type “ZimRate”, then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found us, you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by! Clicking “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.

### Manual installation

1. Upload `no-updates.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What it if i change my mind?

Simple, Wordpress will refresh plugin and theme versions when you visit the updates page or update at least one.

#### Why do some plugins/themes not have a reinstall option?

Most probably they do not have a download link and where probably manually installed and ending up having a different link than what is available from WordPress.org

#### Will my data be affected?

No. This will just effectively force WordPress to replace plugin or theme files only, nothing else.
