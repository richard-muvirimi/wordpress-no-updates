Hide plugin and theme updates

== Description ==

Want to hide plugin and theme updates, maybe because:
1. You have a stagging site and do not want the main site to be tempered with.
2. Stop users from updating the site and maybe ending up breaking the site.
3. Have multiple sites and want to maintain same plugin and theme versions across all sites

Just activate the plugin to hide updates and disable when you need to update

Note: Updating WordPress plugins and themes is highly recommended as updates usually bring security updates and sometimes restricted functionality ;P

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option -- WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of No Update, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”
 
In the search field type “No Update”, then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found us,  you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by! Clicking “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.

= Manual installation =

1. Upload `no-updates` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
